STEP 7: SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------
Semantic Meaning of Embedding:
  - This 768-dimensional vector represents the semantic meaning
    of the enhanced resume text in a high-dimensional space
  - Each dimension captures different aspects of the text's meaning
  - Positive values indicate presence/strength of certain semantic features
  - Negative values indicate absence/opposite of certain semantic features
  - Values near zero indicate neutral/irrelevant features

Text Features Captured:
  - Professional skills: 5 skills identified
  - Job-related terms: 18 job keywords found
  - Industry context: 7 industry terms detected
  - Experience level: Derived from job titles and descriptions
  - Technical expertise: Captured through skill mentions
  - Career trajectory: Inferred from experience progression

STEP 8: PREPARATION FOR CAREER MATCHING
--------------------------------------------------
Embedding Ready for Comparison:
  - User embedding: 768 dimensions
  - Career database: 78 career embeddings
  - Similarity metric: Cosine similarity
  - Expected output: Ranked list of career matches

Next Steps in Pipeline:
  1. Calculate cosine similarity with each career embedding
  2. Rank careers by similarity score
  3. Filter by minimum similarity threshold
  4. Return top recommendations with confidence scores

Generated: 2025-08-12T05:05:37.522036
================================================================================
# This vector encodes the semantic meaning of:
# 'Gunawan Siswo Kuncoro - Front-End Developer with ML experience'
# and can now be compared with career embeddings using cosine similarity
```

STEP 11: TRANSITION TO SIMILARITY COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------
```python
# USER EMBEDDING IS NOW READY FOR COMPARISON
user_embedding_ready = True

# NEXT: The similarity comparison process will:
# 1. Load pre-computed career embeddings from database
# 2. Calculate cosine similarity between user and each career
# 3. Rank careers by similarity score
# 4. Filter by minimum threshold
# 5. Return top recommendations

# The detailed similarity comparison process is documented in:
# 'similarity_comparison_process.txt'
```
